# Container Scheduling Methods in Cloud Environments

This repository includes my seminar article on container scheduling in cloud environments. It was produced for the Seminar in Computer Science course at Aalto University in April 2025. The full article can be read [here](seminar.pdf).

## Abstract

Containerization has emerged as a key technology in cloud computing
due to its lightweight virtualization, making it ideal for both short-lived
tasks and long-running services. Its compatibility with the microservice ar-
chitecture paradigm has further driven adoption, enabling scalable, mod-
ular, and efficient service deployment. However, as application demands
evolve, effective container scheduling becomes critical for optimizing re-
source utilization, minimizing costs, and enhancing performance. Tradi-
tional scheduling techniques such as bin packing, spread, and random
allocation leave room for improvement. This paper explores advanced
scheduling methods, including deep reinforcement learning, meta-heuristic
approaches, and mathematical modeling, which offer significant improve-
ments over the conventional techniques. While these state-of-the-art strate-
gies increase resource efficiency and quality of service metrics, scalability
remains a challenge in large-scale cloud environments. Further research is
essential to develop production-ready scheduling frameworks that ensure
optimal workload placement while maintaining computational feasibility
in modern data centers.
